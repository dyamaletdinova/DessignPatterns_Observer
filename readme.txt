This simple lab follows directly the GOF reading example of an MVC model, 
with multiple views of a single model. 
The basic idea is that changes to the model will automatically cause updates in the views

Applying the Observer pattern to avoid tight coupling between the counting (model) logic, 
and the views (GUI display) as it violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
